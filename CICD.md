# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
1. Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
2. Set up a pipeline to trigger on every commit to the desired branch.
3. Steps in the pipeline should include:
  a.  Running unit tests.
  b. Building the Docker image if containerizing the app.
  c. Pushing the Docker image to a container registry.
  d. Deploying the application to the cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku, GCP).

# Deployment Plans:
1. Consider using a containerization tool like Docker for consistency across different environments.
2. Deploy the app in a containerized environment (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalability and ease of management.
3. Use environment variables for configuration, allowing easy changes between different deployment environments (development, production).
