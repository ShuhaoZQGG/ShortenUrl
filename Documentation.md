# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
1. Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
2. Set up a pipeline to trigger on every commit to the desired branch.
3. Steps in the pipeline should include:
  a.  Running unit tests.
  b. Building the Docker image if containerizing the app.
  c. Pushing the Docker image to a container registry.
  d. Deploying the application to the cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku, GCP).

# Deployment Plans:
1. Consider using a containerization tool like Docker for consistency across different environments.
2. Deploy the app in a containerized environment (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalability and ease of management.
3. Use environment variables for configuration, allowing easy changes between different deployment environments (development, production).

# Thoughts on Gaps and Solutions:
1. Logging and Monitoring: Implement a robust logging and monitoring solution.
2. Error Handling: Enhance error handling for more detailed error messages and logging.
3. Security: Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely, and consider implementing HTTPS for secure communication.
4. Authentication and Authorization
5. Database for persistent storage of Processed Long URL
6. Cache if original url and shortened url will be reused for many times and hardly change
7. Scaling: Plan for scalability by considering load balancing and optimizing database queries.
